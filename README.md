## **ZEROIT DEV UI THEMES**

This is a library for creating various theme controls. I ported most of the themes from Visual Basic (VB) to C#. I started this project as a way of practicing the C# language. After completing this project and reading through numerous source codes from developers on [codeproject](https://www.codeproject.com/) and [github](https://github.com/), I saw it very useful to help others who intend to learn the language through publishing this project and others.

However, it should be noted that this project is not without any flaws and as such, there is a higher possibility of me changing some of the code to reflect current C# conventions and best practices.  



## WHERE TO FIND

This library is available as a NuGet package at [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Zeroit.Framework.UIThemes/).
